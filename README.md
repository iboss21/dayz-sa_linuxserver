# dayz-sa_linuxserver

This Script is a fork of the [Linux Game Server Manager](https://linuxgsm.com) and modified to run a DayZ Standalone Exprimental Community Server!
It makes use of `tmux` to seperate it from the user shell. It runs completely on the console so you can run it on a Root or V-Server with SSH access.
